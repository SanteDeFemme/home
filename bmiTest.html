    <p> 18.5 or less = underweight. Treatment: Because you are underweight, you will need to eat more calories. The extra calories you should be consuming should come mainly from additional carbohydrates.
To start, set up a realistic goal weight for yourself. Make good nutrition your priority, and weight gain the second. It is best to gain weight slowly and steadily. This will help to ensure that your weight gain is in the form of lean body mass and not excessive fat. Try not to gain more than a 1/2 pound a week.
Here are some ways to prevent gaining unwanted fat:Drink 6-8 glasses of distilled water a day. Instead of eating 3 large meals a day, break the meals up and have small meals throughout the day.
Eat lots of raw fruits and vegetables (green leafy vegetables are great)Do not drink coffee, alcohol, soda pop,...Do not eat processed foods; white sugar, white flour, Hydrogenated oils, etc. Avoid red meat and animal fats. Reduce intake of dairy products. Do not smoke and avoid second hand smoke.</p>
