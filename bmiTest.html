    <p> 18.5 or less = underweight. Treatment: 
Treatment: Because you are underweight, you will need to eat more calories. The extra calories you should be consuming should come mainly from additional carbohydrates.
To start, set a realistic goal weight for yourself. Make nutrition your priority, and weight gain the second. It is best to gain weight slowly to make sure your weight gain is in the form of lean body mass and not fat. Try not to gain more than a 1/2 pound a week.
Here are some ways to promote a healthier lifestyle: Drink at least 6-8 glasses of water a day. Instead of eating 3 large meals a day, break the meals up and have small meals throughout the day.
Eat lots of raw fruits and vegetables (green leafy vegetables are great)
Do not drink coffee, alcohol, or soda,...
Do not eat processed foods; white sugar, white flour, Hydrogenated oils, etc. 
Itâ€™s best to avoid red meat and animal fats. Reduce intake of dairy products. 
Do not smoke and try to avoid second-hand smoke.

   <p> 18.5 - 24.99 = Normal Weight. Treatment: You are doing everything right! Keep doing you and love your body :) </p>
   <p> 25 - 29.99 = Overweight. Treatment: Your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. Try to consume less food to lose weight. The idea is that if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. Additionally, incorporating exercise into your daily routine will allow you to begin losing weight. You probably wont see a big change very quickly, however you are becoming healthy! Try to make simple and easily achievable goals every month, for example, weigh 4-8 pounds less than your current weight this month. 
      Here are some very simple changes that you can start today that will greatly improve your chances of weight loss success:
Eliminate Red Meat, If foods like burgers are basic to your current diet, cutting out red meat can go a long way in helping you make healthier meal choices. Build your meals around fish or poultry.; Cut out fried foods,
Grill, bake, roast, broil or boil your food. This also means doing without French Fries and snack foods like Potato Strings, Chips,...
Start with a soup or a salad
By starting dinner with a soup or salad, you will curb your hunger, which will in turn help you keep portion sizes in check and prevent you from overeating.
Stop Cola consumption
For every 20 ounces of Coca-Cola you drink, you're consuming 250 calories. If you're trying to consume around 1500 calories a day in order to lose weight, you can blow your entire calorie budget on soda!
Drink water
Reach for the goal of eight glasses a day. Even if you don't drink eight, you're drinking more than usual.</p>
    <p> 30 -34.99 = Obesity (class 1). Treatment: The method of treatment depends on your level of obesity, overall health condition, and motivation to lose weight. Treatment includes a combination of diet, exercise, behavior modification, and sometimes weightloss drugs. In some cases of severe obesity, gastrointestinal surgery may be recommended. If you are overweight, losing as little as 7-10 percent of your body weight may improve many of the problems linked to being overweight, such as high blood pressure and diabetes.
Slow and steady weight loss of no more than 1-2 pounds per week is the safest way to lose weight. Too rapid weight loss can cause you to lose muscle rather than fat. It also increases your chances of developing other problems, such as gallstones and nutrient deficiencies. Making long-term changes in your eating and physical activity habits is the only way to lose weight and keep it off!
Whether you are trying to lose weight or maintain your weight, you must improve your eating habits. Eat a variety of foods, especially pasta, rice, wholemeal bread, and other whole-grain foods. Reduce your fat-intake. You should also eat lots of fruits and vegetables.
Making physical activity a part of your daily life is an important way to help control your weight. Try to do at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day on most days of the week. The activity does not have to be done all at once. It can be done in stages: 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there, providing it adds up to 30 minutes a day. </p>
