form of lean body mass and not fat. Try not to gain more than a 1/2 pound a week. Here are some ways to promote a healthier \
lifestyle: Drink at least 6-8 glasses of water a day. Instead of eating 3 large meals a day, break the meals up and have small \
meals throughout the day. Eat lots of raw fruits and vegetables (green leafy vegetables are great) Do not drink coffee, \
alcohol, or soda,...Do not eat processed foods; white sugar, white flour, Hydrogenated oils, etc. It’s best to avoid red meat \
and animal fats. Reduce intake of dairy products. Do not smoke and try to avoid second-hand smoke.";

right away, however your body is changing! Try to make simple and easily achievable goals every month, for example, try to \
become 4-8 pounds less than your current weight this month. Here are some changes that you can start today that will improve \
your chances of weight loss: Cut out red meat. Eliminating red meat can go a long way in helping you make healthier meal \
choices. Start to incorporate more fish and poultry into your meals. Cut out fried foods. Refrain from eating fries, onion \
rings, and other greasy snacks. Practice grilling, roasting, broiling, or boiling your vegetables and meats. Start your meals \
with a soup or salad. When you begin your meals with a soup or salad, it will prevent you from overeating and decrease your \
portion sizes. This way, you are able to have a smaller main course meal. Stop drinking soda! For every 20 ounces of Coke you \
drink, you consume 250 calories which can ruin the amount of calories you are supposed to consume in a day. Drink water :)";

such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Ultimately, the safest way to lose weight is slowly and steadily. You should only be \
losing about 1-2 pounds a week. If you lose weight too fast, you may be losing muscle instead of fat. Decide to make long term \
changes to your diet and exercise to lose your weight and to keep the weight off!! Some changes you can make are to improve \
your eating habits. Begin to eat a variety of foods, like pasta, rice, wholemeal bread, and other whole-grain foods. Try to \
reduce your fat-intake by eating foods that aren’t processed. You should also eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Making \
physical activity a part of your daily life is an important way to help control your weight. Exercise at least 30 minutes a \
day on most days of the week. The exercise activity of your choice does not have to be done all at once. It can be done in \
stages: 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there, providing it adds up to 30 minutes a day.";
